# _sT_ : A Simple _Turing_ Programming Language

## About

This project is to implement a compiler for a simplified [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)) programming language, which is not fully compatible.

It's split into 3 phases:
1. [Lexer & The symbol table](./lexer/)
2. Parser & Type checking
3. Code generation (to Java Bytecode)
